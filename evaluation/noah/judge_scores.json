    "explanation": "4: The model answer is nearly complete and covers all key clinical content, including the importance of 21-gene RT-PCR testing, risk stratification, and decision-making in the absence of the test. However, it is more detailed than necessary and does not emphasize as strongly as the reference answer that 21-gene testing is \"strongly recommended\" and that its result \"directly influences\" the chemotherapy decision, which is a subtle but important point."

    "explanation": "4: The model answer is comprehensive and clinically accurate, covering the indications and limitations of FDG-PET/CT和脑MRI in the context of post-resection surveillance for NSCLC with positive margins. However, it provides more detail than required and introduces nuanced risk stratification and guideline comparisons not present in the reference answer, which could potentially obscure the clear, guideline-based recommendation that routine PET/CT or brain MRI is not indicated without clear evidence of recurrence or symptoms. Minor omissions include not explicitly stating that routine use is not recommended in the absence of clear recurrence, as emphasized in the reference answer."

    "score": 1.0,
    "explanation": "1: The model answer directly contradicts the reference answer on the core clinical point, stating that it is not necessary to complete or interrupt current treatment before switching, which is a major error. Despite providing detailed background and rationale, the fundamental recommendation is incorrect."

    "score": 3.0,
    "explanation": "3: The model answer provides a comprehensive and evidence-based discussion of both systemic therapy and whole-brain radiotherapy, but it incorrectly recommends systemic immunochemotherapy as the first-line treatment, whereas the reference answer clearly states that palliative whole-brain radiotherapy should be prioritized to relieve neurological symptoms and improve quality of life. The model answer omits the critical point that symptom control with WBRT takes precedence in this clinical scenario."

    "explanation": "4: The model answer is comprehensive, evidence-based, and covers all key clinical considerations, but it places较强 emphasis on直接中断当前治疗启用RET靶向药物，未像参考答案那样明确将“完成原定一线及维持治疗”与“中断后直接启用RET靶向药物”并列为同等推荐选项，且对“具体应权衡病情进展情况和治疗耐受性”表述略显次要。整体内容详实，临床要点无重大遗漏，仅"

    "explanation": "5: The model answer contains all the key clinical content of the reference answer, clearly stating that fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki can be recommended for advanced squamous NSCLC with HER2 mutation and PS 0–2, without additional histological or molecular prerequisites. It also provides extra relevant clinical context and supporting data, but does not omit or contradict any required information."

    "score": 3.0,
    "explanation": "3: The model answer provides a comprehensive overview of follow-up strategies and relevant guidelines, but it incorrectly suggests that immediate intensification of imaging is not necessary and recommends waiting up to 3 months for repeat imaging, which contradicts the reference answer’s clear recommendation to increase imaging frequency upon new radiological abnormalities. This represents a significant clinical omission."

    "score": 5.0,
    "explanation": "5: The model answer contains all the key clinical content from the reference answer, with no major omissions or errors. It provides a comprehensive, evidence-based rationale for continued smoking cessation interventions, addresses both behavioral and pharmacological strategies, and aligns with guideline recommendations, fully covering the reference answer’s points."

    "score": 4.0,
    "explanation": "4: The model answer is nearly complete and demonstrates a thorough understanding of the clinical scenario, including detailed discussion of molecular status, treatment sequencing, and guideline recommendations. However, it somewhat overemphasizes the need for immediate systemic therapy in driver-positive patients, whereas the reference answer more clearly prioritizes local control first in all cases with low metastatic burden, representing a minor deviation from the reference's core message."

    "score": 4.0,
    "explanation": "4: The model answer is comprehensive and accurate, correctly stating that a tumor size of 1.1 cm (cT1c) in TNBC meets the criteria for considering neoadjuvant systemic therapy, and provides detailed evidence and guideline references. However, it introduces some ambiguity by emphasizing \"individualized decision\" and \"cautious consideration,\" whereas the reference answer is more definitive that 1.1 cm is sufficient for the indication, resulting in a minor omission of decisiveness."

    "explanation": "4: The model answer is nearly complete and provides a thorough, guideline-based rationale for initiating systemic therapy without waiting for molecular testing in advanced squamous NSCLC with malignant pleural effusion. However, it slightly overemphasizes the acceptability of starting treatment before obtaining molecular results, whereas the reference answer stresses the priority of obtaining molecular information first, especially for guiding individualized therapy. Minor nuances regarding the timing and necessity of testing are not fully aligned."

    "score": 3.0,
    "explanation": "3: The model answer provides a detailed and well-structured discussion, but it incorrectly concludes that switching to annual low-dose CT at 2 years is within standard guidelines, whereas the reference answer states this is premature and exceeds standard monitoring boundaries. This represents a significant clinical inaccuracy despite otherwise comprehensive content."

    "explanation": "3: The model answer provides a detailed and evidence-based discussion, but it introduces significant additional stratification and suggests that most COPD patients with 5mm nodules should have 6-month CT follow-up, which is not supported by current guidelines. The reference answer clearly states that even with COPD, 12-month (optional) follow-up is sufficient for <6mm nodules, so the model answer contains notable inaccuracies and overstates the need for more intensive surveillance."

    "explanation": "4: The model answer is nearly complete and covers all key clinical content, including the importance of preoperative pulmonary function testing, alternative assessments, and individualized decision-making. However, it introduces more detail and algorithmic steps than the reference, which, while not incorrect, slightly diverges from the concise focus of the reference answer. No major omissions or errors are present."

    "score": 3.0,
    "explanation": "3: The model answer provides a comprehensive discussion but inaccurately states that the follow-up frequency for radiotherapy is the same as for surgery, missing the key point that radiotherapy patients require more frequent imaging (every 3–6 months) in the first 3 years, as specified in the reference answer. This is a significant omission, though the answer covers other relevant aspects."

    "explanation": "4: The model answer is nearly complete and covers all key clinical points, including the prioritization of local treatment for resectable brain metastasis and subsequent systemic therapy, as well as alternative strategies for different molecular subtypes and symptom status. However, it is more detailed and complex than the reference answer, and could be considered to slightly overcomplicate the core recommendation, but there are no major omissions or errors."

    "score": 4.0,
    "explanation": "4: The model answer is nearly complete and covers all key clinical points, including not recommending routine brain MRI or PET/CT in asymptomatic patients, and emphasizes risk stratification and MDT discussion. However, it introduces a complex risk stratification and follow-up algorithm that, while evidence-based, goes beyond the scope of the reference answer and may slightly overcomplicate the decision process for the specific scenario described. No major errors, but some minor over-elaboration."

    "explanation": "3: The model answer provides a comprehensive and detailed discussion, but it deviates from the reference answer by not recommending erlotinib, gefitinib, or dacomitinib as first-line options for S768I single mutation, instead prioritizing osimertinib and afatinib. This contradicts the reference answer, which states that erlotinib, gefitinib, and dacomitinib can be prioritized, leading to significant content discrepancies."
