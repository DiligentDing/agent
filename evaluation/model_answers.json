  "87": "The agent described is likely **thalidomide** or its analog **lenalidomide**, which are immunomodulatory drugs sometimes used off-label for refractory Crohn disease.\n\nThe molecular target most directly responsible for the therapeutic effects of this agent is:\n\n**Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)** — thalidomide inhibits TNF-α production, contributing to its anti-inflammatory effect.\n\nAdditionally, thalidomide is well-known for **anti-angiogenic effects** primarily by interfering with **vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)** and **basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)**, thereby reducing new blood vessel formation.\n\n**Most directly:**\n> **Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)**\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe question emphasizes reduction of new blood vessel formation (angiogenesis) by interfering with a specific growth factor. VEGF is the primary molecular target mediating angiogenesis and inflammation in this context.\n\n**Final answer:**  \n**Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)**",
  "88": "The described patient has **acromegaly** due to a **GH-secreting pituitary adenoma**. She is started on a medication that mimics an endogenous peptide hormone (**somatostatin analog**, e.g., **octreotide**) that binds to a **G protein–coupled receptor** on pituitary somatotrophs to inhibit GH secretion.\n\n**Question:**  \nWhich receptor subtype is the primary molecular target for this medication's therapeutic action?\n\n**Answer:**  \n**Somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (SSTR2)**\n\n**Explanation:**  \nSomatostatin analogs (like octreotide and lanreotide) mimic the action of endogenous somatostatin and act primarily by binding to **somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (SSTR2)** on pituitary somatotrophs, thereby inhibiting GH release. These receptors are G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs). While somatostatin has five receptor subtypes (SSTR1-5), SSTR2 is the main subtype mediating the inhibitory effect on GH secretion targeted by these drugs.",
  "89": "The patient has **primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)** (also known as premature ovarian failure), evidenced by:\n\n- Secondary amenorrhea\n- Elevated FSH and LH (hypergonadotropic hypogonadism)\n- Low estradiol\n- Vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes, night sweats)\n\n**Therapy:**  \nShe is started on a daily **oral synthetic estrogen** to replace her deficient hormone and treat vasomotor symptoms and prevent osteoporosis.\n\n**Mechanism:**  \nEstrogens exert their action by binding **estrogen receptors (ERs)**, which are **nuclear hormone receptors**. Once bound, these receptors act as **transcription factors** to regulate gene expression.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe specific receptor is the **estrogen receptor (ER)**.\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Drug (Oral Estrogen) | Primary Nuclear Receptor Target | Symptom Relief |\n|----------------------|-------------------------------|---------------|\n| Ethinyl estradiol (or similar) | Estrogen Receptor (ER) | Vasomotor symptoms, bone loss prevention |\n\n**Final answer:**  \n**Estrogen receptor (ER)** is the nuclear receptor directly mediating the primary therapeutic effects of this medication.",
  "90": "The enzyme directly inhibited by this medication is **tryptophan hydroxylase**.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe oral agent described is most likely **telotristat ethyl**, which is used for refractory carcinoid syndrome symptoms (diarrhea, flushing) despite somatostatin analogue therapy. Telotristat inhibits **tryptophan hydroxylase**, the rate-limiting enzyme in serotonin (5-HT) biosynthesis. By inhibiting this enzyme, serotonin production in enterochromaffin cells is reduced, lowering 5-HIAA levels and alleviating serotonin-mediated symptoms.\n\n- **Tryptophan hydroxylase** converts tryptophan to 5-hydroxytryptophan, the first and rate-limiting step in the synthesis of serotonin.",
  "91": "The key details in the question are:\n\n- **Cholelithiasis (biliary stones)**\n- **Experimental enzymatic treatment**\n- **Depletes a specific amino acid substrate**\n- **Affects cellular processes dependent on this molecule**\n- **Marked reduction in the serum level of this amino acid**\n\nIn the context of gallstones and investigational therapies, one relevant experimental strategy is the use of **cholesterol stones** (most common form of gallstones). But these are not directly related to an amino acid.\n\nLet’s focus on the “enzymatic therapy” depleting an “amino acid” substrate. Among enzymatic therapies that remove amino acids, the two classic examples in medicine are:\n\n- **Asparaginase** (depletes asparagine, used in ALL)\n- **Arginase/arginine deiminase** (depletes arginine, studied in some cancers)\n\nBut what's relevant to **bile** or **cholelithiasis**?\n\n**The important link is glycine and taurine**, which are conjugated with bile acids to form bile salts. **Taurine** is a sulfur-containing amino acid, and **glycine** is another amino acid, both conjugated to bile acids in the liver.\n\nHowever, regarding drugs that target amino acids used in conjugating bile acids: **Taurine** and **glycine** are the main amino acid conjugates.\n\nIf an enzyme depletes taurine, it would reduce formation of tauro-conjugated bile acids. If it depletes glycine, it would reduce glyco-conjugated bile acids. This would **affect bile salt formation and, ultimately, cholesterol solubilization in bile**, thus influencing the formation/dissolution of stones.\n\nTherefore, the **direct target biomolecule** of the enzymatic therapy, given it is an amino acid whose depletion affects biliary biochemistry, is most likely:\n\n**Glycine**\n\n**or**\n\n**Taurine**\n\nThe question stem says, \"marked reduction in the serum level of this amino acid\" — not peptide or other compound. Among the two, most drugs would target taurine specifically because it's more unique (and drugs depleting glycine would have lots of systemic metabolic consequences).\n\n**Most likely answer:**  \n**Taurine** (since it's an amino acid used in bile acid conjugation and has been experimentally targeted in biliary studies).\n\n**Final answer:**  \n**Taurine** is the biomolecule directly targeted by the enzymatic therapy.",
  "92": "The patient has **Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndrome (CAPS)**, a rare autoinflammatory syndrome caused by gain-of-function mutations in the **NLRP3 gene** (which encodes cryopyrin).

The medication is most likely **anakinra**, an IL-1 receptor antagonist, or it could be canakinumab, a monoclonal antibody against IL-1β.\n\n**Direct molecular target inhibited:**  \n**Interleukin-1 receptor type I (IL-1R1)**\n\nThis receptor is blocked, preventing IL-1 (primarily IL-1β) from binding and activating downstream inflammatory cascades.\n\n**Summary answer:**  \n**Interleukin-1 receptor type I (IL-1R1)**",
  "93": "**Primary molecular target:**  \nThe **histamine H₂ receptor** on gastric parietal cells.\n\n**Mechanism of symptom alleviation through receptor antagonism:**  \nHistamine H₂ receptors are **G-protein-coupled receptors** (Gs) located on the basolateral membrane of gastric parietal cells. When these receptors are activated by histamine (released from enterochromaffin-like cells), they stimulate adenylate cyclase, increase cyclic AMP (cAMP), and activate protein kinase A, leading to enhanced proton (H⁺) secretion into the gastric lumen via the H⁺/K⁺-ATPase pump (the proton pump).\n\n**Competitive antagonists** of the H₂ receptor (e.g., ranitidine, famotidine, cimetidine) block histamine's action at these sites, reducing cAMP production and thus diminishing gastric acid secretion. Lower acid levels in the stomach reduce the acidity of refluxate into the esophagus, which alleviates the patient's symptoms of heartburn and esophagitis.\n\n**Summary Statement (for exams):**  \nThe primary molecular target is the histamine H₂ receptor (a GPCR) on parietal cells; antagonism at this receptor decreases gastric acid secretion, thereby reducing gastroesophageal reflux and relieving esophagitis symptoms.",
