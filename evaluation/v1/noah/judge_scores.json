    "explanation": "3: The model answer provides a thorough and detailed follow-up plan, but it includes several recommendations (e.g., routine PET/CT, brain MRI, and laboratory tests) that are not supported by current guidelines for asymptomatic patients, and it omits the specific 3-6 month interval for the first 3 years as stated in the reference. There are also some inaccuracies regarding the frequency and necessity of certain tests, leading to partial but not guideline-concordant coverage."

    "explanation": "4: The model answer is comprehensive and evidence-based, covering all key points from the reference answer, including the lack of routine recommendation for adjuvant therapy in stage IB without high-risk features and the consideration of adjuvant therapy if high-risk factors are present. It adds detail about EGFR testing and osimertinib, which is a minor extension rather than an omission, but does not explicitly mention all high-risk features listed in the reference answer."

    "explanation": "3: The model answer provides a thorough and structured approach, including frequency, imaging, clinical assessment, and special considerations, but introduces biomarker monitoring (ctDNA, PD-L1) and extended imaging not routinely recommended in standard guidelines for asymptomatic follow-up, and overemphasizes R1-specific intensification without clear guideline support. There are some omissions (e.g., lack of explicit mention of low-dose CT, not clearly stating that PET/CT and brain MRI are not routinely recommended) and minor inaccuracies regarding standard practice."

  "77": {
    "score": 4.0,
    "explanation": "4: The model answer is comprehensive and aligns closely with the reference answer, covering surveillance intervals, imaging modalities, and additional follow-up considerations. However, it slightly deviates by recommending annual imaging after year 2 (rather than every 6 months for years 3–5 as in the reference), and it does not explicitly mention the option of low-dose CT after 5 years, resulting in minor omissions."

    "explanation": "3: The model answer provides a reasonable discussion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy indications and next steps, but it omits key details such as the importance of preoperative imaging, specific preoperative assessments, and the use of marker clips. It also overemphasizes genomic testing, which is not standard for neoadjuvant decision-making in this context, and does not clearly address the cosmetic considerations for neoadjuvant therapy as highlighted in the reference answer."

    "explanation": "4: The model answer is nearly complete, accurately identifies the stage (IA2/T1bN0M0), and recommends standard surgical treatment, including lobectomy and lymph node dissection. It also discusses sublobar resection and SBRT for inoperable cases, which, while thorough, slightly exceeds the scope of the reference answer and omits the specific mention of considering adjuvant therapy if high-risk features are found intra- or post-operatively."

    "explanation": "4: The model answer provides a comprehensive and accurate discussion of the recommended management, correctly prioritizing switching to a next-generation ALK TKI (such as alectinib or lorlatinib) and justifying this with evidence. However, it is somewhat verbose and includes extraneous details (e.g., future trial data, graphical algorithms) that, while not incorrect, are not strictly necessary for the clinical decision at hand. The core clinical content is nearly complete with only minor omissions."

There is some inaccuracy regarding the routine use of targeted/immunotherapy in this context, leading to partial but not complete alignment with the reference answer."

    "score": 3.0,
    "explanation": "3: The model answer provides a comprehensive and up-to-date discussion of biomarker-driven adjuvant therapy, but it omits the clear, guideline-based recommendation for platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy as the standard of care for Stage IIB NSCLC post-R0 resection, which is the core of the reference answer. It overemphasizes ctDNA and immunotherapy, which are not yet standard in this setting, and does not clearly state that adjuvant radiotherapy is generally not recommended unless there is a positive margin or extranodal extension."
  },

    "score": 3.0,
    "explanation": "3: The model answer provides a thorough and structured discussion, but it overcomplicates the staging by focusing on visceral pleural invasion (VPI), which is not mentioned or implied in the case, and introduces unnecessary details (e.g., stair-climb test, CPET) not required by the question.
