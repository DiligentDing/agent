  "5": {
    "score": 4.0,
    "explanation": "4: The model answer is nearly complete and provides a detailed, guideline-based rationale, but it diverges from the reference answer by stating that ALND is not always required if technical criteria are met, whereas the reference answer recommends routine ALND regardless. This represents a minor but important difference in clinical recommendation."

    "explanation": "4: The model answer is nearly complete and covers the key points, including the feasibility of non-anthracycline regimens for HER2-positive patients with liver dysfunction. However, it introduces extra background and guideline discussion, and the conclusion is incomplete, missing a direct, concise statement that preoperative systemic therapy is still possible with non-anthracycline regimens."
