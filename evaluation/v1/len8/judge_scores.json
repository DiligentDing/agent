    "score": 4.0,
    "explanation": "4: The model answer is nearly complete and covers all key points, including the need for individualized assessment, potential for dose adjustment or drug selection, multidisciplinary evaluation, and the option of supportive care. However, it is more detailed than the reference and slightly overstates severe renal dysfunction as an absolute or relative contraindication, whereas the reference emphasizes individualized decision-making without such strong wording."

  },
  "6": {
    "score": 3.0,
    "explanation": "3: The model answer provides a reasonable discussion of the role of systemic and local therapies in patients with poor performance status, but it incorrectly states that systemic therapy is not the preferred option, whereas the reference answer clearly states systemic therapy is the first choice. The model answer also introduces best supportive care as the mainstay, which is not mentioned in the reference, leading to some inaccuracies and omissions."

  "12": {
    "score": 4.0,
    "explanation": "4: The model answer is nearly complete and accurately highlights COPD as a high-risk factor, recommending a shorter follow-up interval. However, it does not explicitly state that the standard 6–12 month interval may be insufficient and that individualized management should be considered, as emphasized in the reference answer."
  },
  "13": {
    "score": 3.0,
    "explanation": "3: The model answer provides a reasonable discussion of both systemic and local treatments, but it incorrectly prioritizes local treatment for brain metastasis over systemic therapy, which contradicts the reference answer's emphasis on systemic therapy as the primary approach. There are also some minor inaccuracies regarding guideline recommendations."

  "17": {
    "score": 4.0,
    "explanation": "4: The model answer is nearly complete and aligns closely with the reference answer, but it overstates the necessity of 12-month follow-up (“不应停止随访”) rather than emphasizing that follow-up is optional and not mandatory for all patients, as the reference answer notes."
  },
  "18": {
    "score": 5.0,
    "explanation": "5: The model answer fully covers the clinical reasoning and key points of the reference answer, including the rationale for starting treatment based on histology and PD-L1, the low priority of molecular testing in squamous cell carcinoma, and the need to adjust therapy if further molecular results become available. No major omissions or errors are present."
