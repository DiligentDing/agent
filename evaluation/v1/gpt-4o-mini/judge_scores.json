    "explanation": "4: The model answer covers most key points, including correct staging, the need for molecular and PD-L1 testing, and outlines systemic and supportive treatments. However, it omits some specific recommendations such as the use of bone-modifying agents (bisphosphonates or Denosumab), details on palliative radiotherapy, and smoking cessation advice."
  },
  "83": {
    "score": 4.0,
    "explanation": "4: The model answer covers most key points, including accurate clinical staging and essential preoperative assessments, but omits specific mention of tumor bed marker placement, detailed blood tests, and the rationale for certain imaging choices, which are present in the reference answer."
  },
  "84": {
    "score": 4.0,
    "explanation": "4: The model answer covers most key points, including indications for neoadjuvant therapy, risk features, and next steps in evaluation and management. However, it omits some specific details such as the importance of breast-conserving surgery considerations, the placement of marker clips, and the approach to axillary evaluation, which are present in the reference answer."
  },
  "85": {
    "score": 5.0,
    "explanation": "5: The model answer accurately covers all key clinical points, including the rarity of ALK rearrangement in squamous cell carcinoma, guideline recommendations, and the appropriateness of crizotinib as first-line systemic therapy, with no major omissions or errors."
  },
  "86": {
    "score": 3.0,
    "explanation": "3: The model answer correctly identifies RET抑制剂为主要治疗，但错误推荐了cabozantinib（非RET特异性抑制剂），未提及骨保护治疗和化疗的替代方案，也未强调镇痛和姑息治疗需求，内容有部分遗漏和不准确。"
  },
  "87": {
    "score": 4.0,
    "explanation": "4: The model answer is nearly complete and covers all key points, including follow-up frequency, imaging recommendations, and indications for brain MRI or PET/CT. However, it omits the recommendation for smoking cessation counseling and is slightly less specific about the duration and type of CT (e.g., low-dose CT after 2–3 years)."
  },
  "88": {
    "score": 4.0,
    "explanation": "4: The model answer is nearly complete, accurately describes the staging and standard treatment, but incorrectly classifies the tumor as T1a instead of T1b (1.5 cm falls into T1b per current TNM), and does not specifically mention区域淋巴结清扫, which is a key detail in the reference answer."
  },
  "89": {
    "score": 3.0,
    "explanation": "3: The model answer covers the general approach of surgery and systemic therapy, but omits the recommendation for mastectomy (rather than just local excision), lacks mention of axillary staging, and incorrectly suggests routine consideration of re-irradiation, which is generally not recommended after prior radiotherapy."
  },
  "90": {
    "score": 3.0,
    "explanation": "3: The model answer covers the general approach of surgical excision and follow-up but omits key details such as the recommendation for central breast excision (not仅乳头切除), sentinel lymph node biopsy, and the option of adjuvant radiotherapy or total mastectomy based on patient preference. It also overemphasizes preoperative imaging, which has already been performed per the scenario."
  },
  "91": {
    "score": 3.0,
    "explanation": "3: The model answer correctly identifies the need to switch to ALK抑制剂治疗 and mentions crizotinib, but omits the recommendation for newer generation ALK inhibitors (alectinib, brigatinib, lorlatinib) as first-line, and does not discuss the option of completing current chemotherapy or maintenance therapy."
  },
  "92": {
    "score": 3.0,
    "explanation": "3: The model answer covers several key steps such as brain imaging, multidisciplinary discussion, and general treatment principles, but omits specific recommendations for molecular testing (including PD-L1 and rare mutations in squamous cell carcinoma), does not emphasize同步放化疗 as the standard of care, and includes some less relevant steps (e.g., bone scan after PET-CT). There are also inaccuracies regarding the role of surgery and the prioritization of treatment modalities."
  },
  "93": {
    "score": 4.0,
    "explanation": "4: The model answer covers most key points, including 6-monthly chest CT, clinical follow-up, and smoking cessation advice, but adds more frequent clinical visits and tumor marker testing, which are not standard per the reference. It omits the transition to annual CT after year 3 and the specific mention of low-dose CT."
  },
  "94": {
    "score": 4.0,
    "explanation": "4: The model answer covers most key points, including the need for further local treatment (radiotherapy), consideration of chemotherapy, and appropriate follow-up imaging. However, it omits优先考虑再次手术切除残余肿瘤 as首选, and does not specifically mention戒烟干预 or肿瘤生存管理, which are minor but relevant omissions."
  },
  "95": {
    "score": 4.0,
    "explanation": "4: The model answer is nearly complete and covers the main points, including adjuvant chemotherapy, platinum-based regimens, and consideration of targeted therapy. It adds mention of immunotherapy, which is emerging but not yet standard for this stage, and omits the explicit statement that adjuvant radiotherapy is generally not recommended unless there is positive margin or extranodal extension. Minor omissions and slight over-inclusiveness prevent a perfect score."
  },
  "96": {
    "score": 4.0,
    "explanation": "4: The model answer is nearly complete, correctly identifies the stage (though uses T1aN0M0 instead of T1bN0M0), and lists appropriate preoperative assessments. However, it omits强调术中或术前纵隔淋巴结评估以排除隐匿转移这一关键点。"

  "97": {
    "score": 4.0,
    "explanation": "4: The model answer is nearly complete and correctly identifies the clinical stage and outlines appropriate next steps, but it omits some minor but relevant details such as recommending preoperative MRI, routine labs, and specific mention of tumor localization before surgery."
  },
  "98": {
    "score": 2.0,
    "explanation": "2: The model answer omits the critical standard of care—concurrent chemoradiotherapy—and instead incorrectly emphasizes chemotherapy combined with targeted or immunotherapy, which is not the guideline-recommended first-line for unresectable stage IIIB NSCLC. It also fails to mention durvalumab consolidation and does not specify the role of radiotherapy, representing notable errors and limited coverage."
