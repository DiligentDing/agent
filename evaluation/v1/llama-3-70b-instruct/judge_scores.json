    "explanation": "3: The model answer covers hormonal therapy and monitoring but omits the key recommendation of combining a CDK4/6 inhibitor with an aromatase inhibitor, which is now standard first-line therapy. It also overemphasizes bone-directed and pain management, which, while important, are supportive rather than primary systemic treatments."
  },
  "81": {
    "score": 4.0,
    "explanation": "4: The model answer covers most key points, including neoadjuvant chemotherapy with anti-HER2 therapy, surgery, and consideration of adjuvant radiation and endocrine therapy. However, it omits the use of dual HER2 blockade (trastuzumab plus pertuzumab) and does not specify the total duration of HER2-targeted therapy, which are minor but relevant omissions."
  },
  "82": {
    "score": 4.0,
    "explanation": "4: The model answer covers the key points of staging, the need for molecular profiling, systemic therapy options, bone protection, and multidisciplinary care, but omits explicit mention of PD-L1 testing, specific guideline-recommended gene panels, and smoking cessation intervention."
  },
  "83": {
    "score": 3.0,
    "explanation": "3: The model answer covers some key points such as clinical staging, blood tests, and imaging, but incorrectly stages the tumor as T2N0M0 (should be cT1cN0M0) and omits essential steps like tumor and axillary marker placement. It also includes less relevant details (e.g., genetic testing, cardiac evaluation) not prioritized in the reference answer."
  },
  "84": {
    "score": 3.0,
    "explanation": "3: The model answer covers the general rationale for neoadjuvant systemic therapy and outlines next steps, but it omits key details such as the importance of breast size relative to tumor size, specific preoperative assessments (e.g., blood tests, MRI, marker placement), and sentinel lymph node biopsy planning. It also overstates the indication for NST in HR+HER2- tumors and lacks some guideline-based nuances."
  },
  "85": {
    "score": 5.0,
    "explanation": "5: The model answer contains all key clinical content, correctly identifies crizotinib as the first-line treatment for ALK-rearranged NSCLC, addresses the irrelevance of PD-L1 status in this context, and matches the reference answer with no major omissions or errors."
  },
  "86": {
    "score": 4.0,
    "explanation": "4: The model answer covers the main clinical content, recommending RET inhibitor therapy and bone protection, but omits mentioning alternative options (platinum-based chemotherapy ± immunotherapy if RET inhibitors are unavailable) and the need to assess for pain and palliative care."
  },
  "87": {
    "score": 4.0,
    "explanation": "4: The model answer covers the key points of follow-up frequency, imaging modality, and the lack of indication for routine brain MRI or PET/CT, but omits specific mention of smoking cessation counseling and does not specify the use of low-dose CT or the option of contrast-enhanced CT."
  },
  "88": {
    "score": 4.0,
    "explanation": "4: The model answer covers the key points of staging and standard treatment, including surgical resection and lymph node assessment, but omits mention of possible adjuvant therapy if high-risk features are found and does not specify the exact T1b (1.5 cm) substage. Minor details are missing, but overall clinical content is nearly complete."
  },
  "89": {
    "score": 4.0,
    "explanation": "4: The model answer covers most key points, including surgical resection as the mainstay and the general avoidance of re-irradiation. However, it omits the recommendation for mastectomy (rather than just wide local excision), does not mention axillary staging, and lacks detail on the nuanced possibility of re-irradiation in select cases."
  },
  "90": {
    "score": 3.0,
    "explanation": "3: The model answer covers key elements such as excision of the nipple-areola complex and sentinel lymph node biopsy, but it introduces unnecessary further imaging (MRI) despite negative prior imaging, and lacks mention of total mastectomy as an option or the importance of patient preference in decision-making."
  },
  "91": {
    "score": 4.0,
    "explanation": "4: The model answer covers the key clinical content, recommending a switch to ALK-TKI therapy and naming appropriate agents. However, it omits the option of completing the current chemotherapy regimen and does not mention newer-generation ALK inhibitors as preferred, which are minor but relevant details."
  },
  "92": {
    "score": 4.0,
    "explanation": "4: The model answer covers most key points, including brain MRI, multidisciplinary discussion, concurrent chemoradiation, and supportive care, but omits detailed molecular testing (e.g., PD-L1, EGFR, ALK, etc.) and does not mention the low mutation rate in squamous cell carcinoma or the rationale for broad molecular profiling."
  },
  "93": {
    "score": 3.0,
    "explanation": "3: The model answer covers the main points of regular history, physical examination, and chest CT, and emphasizes smoking cessation, but it is less specific about the recommended intervals (suggesting a broader range than the reference) and introduces additional elements (lab tests, screening for other cancers) not required by the reference answer, leading to some inaccuracies and omissions."
  },
  "94": {
    "score": 3.0,
    "explanation": "3: The model answer covers adjuvant chemotherapy and follow-up, but omits the guideline-recommended priority of re-resection for R1 margins and the option of radiotherapy if re-surgery is not feasible. The follow-up intervals and imaging recommendations are less specific than the reference, and some details (e.g., PET/brain imaging) are not standard for routine follow-up."
  },
  "95": {
    "score": 4.0,
    "explanation": "4: The model answer covers almost all key points, including adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy, rationale, and the limited role of radiotherapy. It mentions targeted and immunotherapy as possible options with further testing, but does not specifically mention EGFR/ALK or the exclusion of adjuvant radiotherapy unless there is positive margin or extranodal extension, which are minor omissions."
  },
  "96": {
    "score": 4.0,
    "explanation": "4: The model answer is nearly complete, correctly identifies the stage as IA and lists appropriate preoperative assessments, but it incorrectly specifies T1a instead of T1b (since the nodule is 1.8 cm), and includes some general pre-op tests not specifically required for staging, while omitting the emphasis on intraoperative lymph node assessment."
  },
  "97": {
    "score": 4.0,
    "explanation": "4: The model answer accurately identifies the clinical stage and outlines appropriate next steps, including surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy. However, it omits preoperative imaging (MRI), laboratory workup, and tumor localization, and it introduces genetic testing, which is not specifically indicated by the case details."

  "98": {
    "score": 5.0,
    "explanation": "5: The model answer contains all key clinical content, including concurrent chemoradiation with platinum-based doublet, specific radiation dosing, and consolidation durvalumab, matching the reference answer with no major omissions or errors."
  },
  "99": {
    "score": 4.0,
    "explanation": "4: The model answer covers the key recommendations of adjuvant chemotherapy and consideration of radiotherapy for R1 margin, aligning closely with the reference. However, it omits explicit mention of the option for concurrent chemoradiotherapy and the need to tailor the approach based on the patient's performance status."
