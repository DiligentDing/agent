    "explanation": "5: 模型答案与参考答案临床内容完全一致，分期准确，治疗策略全面，并补充了手术方式和不可手术时的替代方案，无重大遗漏或错误。"

  "89": {
    "score": 4.0,
    "explanation": "4: 模型答案基本涵盖了参考答案的主要内容，包括手术切除、再次放疗的评估及内分泌治疗，但未明确提及全乳切除和腋窝分期的必要性，且对再次放疗的适应证表述略宽泛。"
  },
  "90": {
    "score": 4.0,
    "explanation": "4: The model answer is nearly complete and covers the main surgical options, sentinel lymph node biopsy, and the rationale for complete excision. However, it omits the specific mention of postoperative whole-breast radiotherapy to reduce local recurrence risk in breast-conserving cases and does not emphasize shared decision-making based on patient preference."
  },
  "91": {
    "score": 5.0,
    "explanation": "5: The model answer accurately covers all key clinical points, including immediate switch to ALK-TKI, preferred agents, rationale, and guideline support, with no major omissions or errors."
  },
  "92": {
    "score": 5.0,
    "explanation": "5: The model answer covers all key clinical content, including necessary further investigations (brain MRI, molecular testing), appropriate treatment (concurrent chemoradiotherapy, consideration of immunotherapy), and supportive care, with no major omissions or errors."
  },
  "93": {
    "score": 4.0,
    "explanation": "4: The model answer covers nearly all key points from the reference answer, including 6-monthly chest CT and clinical review, smoking cessation, and not recommending unnecessary imaging. However, it introduces annual low-dose CT for screening, which is not standard in this context, and slightly overstates the frequency of H&P. Minor differences prevent a perfect score."
  },
  "94": {
    "score": 3.0,
    "explanation": "3: The model answer covers key aspects such as adjuvant therapy, radiotherapy for R1 resection, and a structured follow-up plan, but omits优先考虑再次手术切除残余肿瘤这一首选方案，并对随访时间节点与指南推荐不完全一致，存在一定内容偏差。"
  },
  "95": {
    "score": 4.0,
    "explanation": "4: The model answer is nearly complete and covers the key points of adjuvant chemotherapy, molecular testing, and targeted therapy, with appropriate mention of immunotherapy. However, it introduces immunotherapy (atezolizumab) for high PD-L1 expression, which is not included in the reference answer, and could be considered a minor deviation from standard recommendations for this specific stage."
  },
  "96": {
    "score": 4.0,
    "explanation": "4: The model answer is nearly complete and correctly identifies the stage (cT1bN0M0, IA2) and most relevant preoperative assessments, but it includes some additional routine preoperative tests (e.g., bloodwork, cardiac evaluation) not specified in the reference and slightly overemphasizes the need for brain MRI and EBUS-TBNA in a clear N0 case, which are not strictly necessary per the reference answer. Minor omissions include not explicitly stating the need for intraoperative pathological lymph node assessment."
  },
  "97": {
    "score": 4.0,
    "explanation": "4: The model answer is nearly complete and accurately covers the clinical staging and reasonable next steps, including surgery options and adjuvant therapy considerations. However, it omits some minor but relevant preoperative steps such as MRI for further assessment, routine labs, and tumor localization, which are mentioned in the reference answer."
  },
  "98": {
    "score": 4.0,
    "explanation": "4: The model answer is nearly complete, accurately describing concurrent chemoradiotherapy and durvalumab consolidation, but it omits the option of osimertinib maintenance for EGFR-mutant patients and does not specify that durvalumab is recommended regardless of PD-L1 status per current guidelines."
  },
  "99": {
    "score": 4.0,
    "explanation": "4: The model answer covers the key recommendation of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy for R1 resection in stage IIB NSCLC and provides appropriate details on chemotherapy regimens and radiotherapy targets. However, it omits mention of the need for comprehensive patient assessment (e.g., performance status) before therapy and does not discuss the option of sequential versus concurrent chemoradiotherapy, which are minor but relevant details."
