2147276447,The Waterfall Model in Large-Scale Development,"waterfall model,waterfall,waterfall development,industrial","Kai Petersen, Claes Wohlin & Dejan Baca ","Waterfall development is still a widely used way of working in software development companies. Many problems have been reported related to the model. Commonly accepted problems are for example to cope with change and that defects all too often are detected too late in the software development process. However, many of the problems mentioned in literature are based on beliefs and experiences, and not on empirical evidence. To address this research gap, we compare the problems in literature with the results of a case study at Ericsson AB in Sweden, investigating issues in the waterfall model. The case study aims at validating or contradicting the beliefs of what the problems are in waterfall development through empirical research.",,2009,Product-Focused Software Process Improvement,,61
2147276445,A Simulation Model for the Waterfall Software Development Life Cycle,"Software Engineering, SDLC, Waterfall Model, Computer Simulation, Simphony.NET",Youssef Bassil,"Software development life cycle or SDLC for short is a methodology for designing, building, and maintaining information and industrial systems. So far, there exist many SDLC models, one of which is the Waterfall model which comprises five phases to be completed sequentially in order to develop a software solution. However, SDLC of software systems has always encountered problems and limitations that resulted in significant budget overruns, late or suspended deliveries, and dissatisfied clients. The major reason for these deficiencies is that project directors are not wisely assigning the required number of workers and resources on the various activities of the SDLC. Consequently, some SDLC phases with insufficient resources may be delayed; while, others with excess resources may be idled, leading to a bottleneck between the arrival and delivery of projects and to a failure in delivering an operational product on time and within budget. This paper proposes a simulation model for the Waterfall development process using the this http URL simulation tool whose role is to assist project managers in determining how to achieve the maximum productivity with the minimum number of expenses, workers, and hours. It helps maximizing the utilization of development processes by keeping all employees and resources busy all the time to keep pace with the arrival of projects and to decrease waste and idle time. As future work, other SDLC models such as spiral and incremental are to be simulated, giving project executives the choice to use a diversity of software development methodologies.",,2012,Lebanese Association for Computational Sciences,,921
2147276446,Agile versus Waterfall Project Management: Decision Model for Selecting the Appropriate Approach to a Project,agile project managementclassical waterfall project managementdecision modeldecision supportadvantagesdisadvantages,"Theo Thesing , Carsten Feldmann , Martin Burchardt ","Procedural models for project management can be differentiated into plan-driven methods which follow a classical waterfall process and agile methods which follow an iterative, test-driven approach. This paper answers the following research questions: What are the differences, benefits, and constraints of these two approaches from a practitioner’s point of view? How can a decision model be set up to select the most appropriate approach for a concrete project? This study develops a decision model for the selection of a procedural model for project management which is based on the modelling process described by Adam (1996). The research gap was identified based on a systematic and comprehensive analysis of the literature following Vom Brocke et al. (2009), which reflects the state-of-research. Insights gained were compared with empirical data from 15 expert interviews across different industries in Germany. The presented model systematically supports the selection of an appropriate procedural model for a concrete project based on 15 criteria subsumed under the following categories: scope, time, costs, organization context, and project-team characteristics. It closes a relevant research gap, both from a scientific perspective and from the practitioners’ view. Expert interviews ensure practical relevance and significantly expand the state-of-research with regards to decision support on the project-management approach.",,2021, International Conference on ENTERprise Information Systems,,420
