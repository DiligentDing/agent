    "score": 2.0,
    "explanation": "2: The answer mentions some relevant diseases (breast carcinoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, gastric cancer) but omits many key associations from the reference (e.g., neoplasm, urinary bladder carcinoma, ovarian cancer, HER2 positive breast carcinoma) and includes diseases not present in the reference (oesophageal adenocarcinoma, uterine serous carcinoma), resulting in moderate omissions and some irrelevant content."
  },
  "94": {
    "score": 3.0,
    "explanation": "3: The model answer correctly states that it cannot find the PMID due to the knowledge cutoff, which is accurate and safe, but it does not provide the reference PMID and thus omits the key fact required."
  },
  "95": {
    "score": 5.0,
    "explanation": "5: The model answer correctly identifies NCT03207009, includes all key facts from the reference, and provides additional accurate and clinically relevant details without any inaccuracies or omissions."

  "96": {
    "score": 5.0,
    "explanation": "5: The model answer correctly identifies NCT00071799 and provides additional accurate and clinically relevant details without any inaccuracies or omissions."

  "97": {
    "score": 2.0,
    "explanation": "2: The model answer identifies NCT00004713 (MIRACL), which is not the reference study (NCT00327691), and omits the correct trial. While the answer is detailed and relevant, it fails to provide the key fact required by the question, constituting a moderate omission."
  },
  "98": {
    "score": 2.0,
    "explanation": "2: The answer correctly identifies small molecule tractability as True for DRD2 but omits most of the specific tractability labels and modalities (e.g., approved drug, structure with ligand, antibody-related evidence) present in the reference, covering less than 70% of key facts."
  },
  "99": {
    "score": 1.0,
    "explanation": "1: The model answer does not mention any of the diseases listed in the reference answer and instead lists unrelated cancers, covering 0% of key facts."
