    "explanation": "3: The model answer covers most key facts, emphasizing the role of palliative radiotherapy for severe or urgent symptoms and the importance of systemic therapy, but it introduces nuanced stratification (emergent vs. non-emergent symptoms) not present in the reference and may underemphasize the general prioritization of radiotherapy for immediate symptom control, leading to a minor omission in alignment with the reference answer."

  "904": {
    "score": 5.0,
    "explanation": "5: The model answer covers all key clinical facts, correctly identifies chylomicrons as the bypassed molecular component, and provides accurate, relevant explanations without inaccuracies or omissions."

  "905": {
    "score": 5.0,
    "explanation": "5: The model answer covers all key clinical facts from the reference, accurately explains why standard chemotherapy is contraindicated, discusses alternative strategies (upfront surgery, modified regimens, clinical trials), and emphasizes multidisciplinary input and risk assessment, with no inaccuracies or omissions."

  "906": {
    "score": 3.0,
    "explanation": "3: The model answer correctly identifies the clinical diagnosis and standard first-line treatment (topical glucocorticoids for lichen sclerosus) and accurately describes their mechanism of action, but it misses the key fact from the reference answer that the question specifically describes the mechanism of estrogen receptor agonists, not glucocorticoids. The answer is otherwise thorough and contains no unsafe statements, but it does not match the reference's core pharmacological class."

  "907": {
    "score": 4.0,
    "explanation": "4: The model answer correctly identifies the cytochrome P450 system as the inhibited enzyme system and provides relevant details about CYP3A4 and CYP2C9, which are highly pertinent to tacrolimus and warfarin. However, it omits mention of CYP2C19, which is specifically highlighted in the reference answer, constituting a minor omission."
  },
  "908": {
    "score": 2.0,
    "explanation": "2: The model answer provides relevant background on miltefosine and ABC transporters but incorrectly identifies P-glycoprotein (P-gp) as the most relevant transporter, rather than BCRP (ABCG2) as specified in the reference. This constitutes a moderate factual error, though the rest of the content is generally accurate."

  "909": {
    "score": 4.0,
    "explanation": "4: The model answer correctly identifies topoisomerase IV as a molecular target and provides accurate, relevant extra information, but it does not clearly prioritize topoisomerase IV as the answer to the specific question, instead presenting both DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV as co-equal targets, which is a minor wording inaccuracy."
  },
  "910": {
    "score": 2.0,
    "explanation": "2: The model answer covers the staging and rationale for systemic therapy in M1a disease but incorrectly asserts that curative-intent local therapy is never appropriate, missing that technically resectable, solitary contralateral nodules can be managed as two primaries in select cases; this is a moderate factual omission."
  },
  "911": {
    "score": 3.0,
    "explanation": "3: The model answer correctly identifies the clinical scenario, drug, and its immunomodulatory action, but incorrectly names TNF-α as the most direct molecular target, omitting VEGF-A, which is specified in the reference. The rest of the content is accurate and relevant, but this represents a moderate factual error."
  },
  "912": {
    "score": 3.0,
    "explanation": "3: The model answer correctly identifies the clinical syndrome, the drug (defibrotide), and its mechanism as fibrinolytic, but it omits the specific class \"tissue plasminogen activators\" named in the reference answer, which is a key fact; \"fibrinolytic agents\" is broader and less precise."
  },
  "913": {
    "score": 3.0,
    "explanation": "3: The model answer covers most key facts and provides strong rationale for switching to crizotinib, but it incorrectly implies that immediate interruption is always preferred, omitting that either approach (interrupting or completing current therapy) is acceptable per the reference. This is a moderate omission that affects the nuance of the recommendation."
