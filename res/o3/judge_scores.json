    "score": 3.0,
    "explanation": "3: The model answer correctly states that external-beam radiotherapy is standard for stage IIIA disease and not solely for obstruction or recurrence, but it omits the key clinical fact that, in the context of a solitary pulmonary nodule, radiotherapy is typically reserved for cases with local symptoms or recurrence, as highlighted in the reference."

  "891": {
    "score": 2.0,
    "explanation": "2: The model answer omits the key fact that brain MRI is recommended for stage II and above, incorrectly stating that it is not required for asymptomatic stage II patients, which is a moderate factual error; it also fails to recognize that omission compromises staging adequacy in stage II, covering less than 70% of key facts."

    "score": 4.0,
    "explanation": "4: The model answer correctly identifies cyclo-oxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2, also called prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase) as the inhibited enzyme and accurately describes the mechanism, but does not specifically single out COX-1 as the reference answer does; otherwise, all key facts are present."

While the rationale is well-supported and factually correct, it omits that both options (immediate switch or completion of current therapy) are acceptable, thus missing a key fact."
