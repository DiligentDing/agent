  "14": "Yes.  \nAll current major guidelines (e.g., NCCN, ASCO-CAP, ESMO) base the indication for adjuvant trastuzumab-containing chemotherapy on biologic factors (HER2-positivity, tumour size, nodal status) and cardiac fitness—not on the specific invasive histologic subtype. Any HER2-positive invasive carcinoma that is ≥ T1c (≥ 1 cm) or node-positive (> 2 mm metastasis in an ipsilateral node) should receive trastuzumab-based adjuvant systemic therapy, provided there are no contraindications.  \nMetaplastic carcinoma, although uncommon, is still an invasive breast cancer; it is not an exclusion category.

The label does not require documented absence of EGFR, ALK, ROS1 or any other driver alteration.\n\nClinical nuance:  \n• If an additional, well-validated driver such as EGFR, ALK or ROS1 is also present (a rare situation), most clinicians would start with the therapy that targets that established driver first, because its efficacy is better defined in NSCLC.  \n• Nevertheless, the legal/label indication for an NTRK inhibitor remains valid regardless of the status of other drivers, and the drug can be used at any line of therapy.\n\nSo the presence of an NTRK fusion alone is sufficient to justify NTRK-targeted therapy; the absence of other actionable mutations is a practical consideration, not a formal prerequisite.",

They specifically state that chemotherapy begun before results are available “need not be completed” once a targetable driver is identified.\n\nPractical approach  \n1. Complete the current treatment cycle if it is already under way (to avoid tumour flare and logistical issues).  \n2. Stop further cytotoxic or immune-checkpoint therapy.  \n3. Begin alectinib as soon as blood counts have recovered (usually 1–2 weeks after the last chemotherapy dose).  \n   • If the patient has received a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor, allow ~4 weeks and monitor LFTs closely because of the higher risk of hepatotoxicity.  \n4.

Re-stage: Ensure there are no distant metastases (brain MRI, PET/CT).\n2. Re-assess technical feasibility: All gross disease that is still present (the mediastinal nodes plus any active intrapulmonary lesions) must be able to be encompassed in a curative 60 Gy-class plan while keeping lung, oesophagus, heart and spinal cord within standard constraints.  \n   • If the multifocal primaries are indolent or already treated/ablated, the field may be limited to the mediastinum.  \n   • If multiple active lung lesions would push lung V20 or mean lung dose beyond limits, cCRT remains inappropriate.\n3.

Biology: EGFR-mutant cancers are generally “cold” tumours with low tumour-mutational burden and poor, short-lived responses to PD-(L)1 blockade.  \n2. Efficacy data:  \n   – PACIFIC subgroup (EGFRm, n≈43) showed no DFS or OS advantage with durvalumab.  \n   – Phase III ADAURA (resected disease) and phase III LAURA (unresectable post-CRT; top-line results positive, full data pending) demonstrate large DFS benefits with osimertinib.

Cyclobenzaprine is a tricyclic analogue and behaves as an antagonist at 5-HT2 (and, to a lesser extent, α-adrenergic and H1-histaminic) receptors.  By blocking 5-HT2 receptors in the dorsal horn/brain-stem, it is thought to enhance descending serotonergic inhibition of α- and γ-motor-neuron outflow, thereby diminishing tonic muscle activity and the sensation of muscle spasm.\n\n• Secondary pharmacology – anticholinergic and antihistaminic actions produce additional sedation and may blunt the perception of pain, but they are not considered the primary antispastic mechanism.\n\n• What it does NOT do – it has no direct anti-inflammatory effect on muscle fibers and does not alter the immune pathophysiology of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies.\n\nThus, the current consensus is that cyclobenzaprine relieves muscle spasm predominantly by centrally mediated inhibition of polysynaptic motor reflexes—probably through antagonism of 5-HT2 receptors in the brain-stem/spinal cord—although a single, fully defined molecular target has not been conclusively identified.",

In the absence of such proof, they must be managed as metastatic disease, not as two curable primaries.",
  "150": "Yes – provided that the intracranial lesion looks radiologically typical of a NSCLC metastasis and the primary-tumour biopsy has already yielded sufficient tissue for full histology/molecular profiling, it is acceptable to go straight to stereotactic radiosurgery without first biopsying the brain lesion.\n\nRationale and caveats  \n• NCCN, ASTRO and ESMO guidelines state that when stage IV NSCLC has been pathologically confirmed elsewhere, an additional biopsy of a radiologically characteristic brain metastasis is not mandatory if its result would not change immediate management.  \n• Brain biopsy carries morbidity; SRS can be delivered promptly and is standard for patients with 1-10 brain metastases and good PS.  \n• Obtain additional tissue only if (a) imaging is atypical, (b) there is a long disease-free interval raising the possibility of a second primary, (c) the initial lung specimen is inadequate for required molecular tests, or (d) enrolment in a trial demands tissue from the metastatic site.  \n• Multidisciplinary discussion and high-quality MRI are still essential before proceeding.\n\nTherefore, in the typical presentation you describe (stage IVA NSCLC, good PS, classic-appearing solitary brain metastasis, adequate primary-tumour tissue already available), it is reasonable to treat the brain lesion with SRS immediately and forego a neurosurgical biopsy.",

It is investigational as consolidation after CRT; outside a trial it lacks evidence and insurance coverage.  \n• PD-L1 ≥50 % does not outweigh the established poor immunotherapy sensitivity of EGFR-mutant tumors, but it does satisfy the EMA PD-L1 requirement for durvalumab.  \n• Safety: Sequential durvalumab → osimertinib at relapse is feasible with careful pneumonitis monitoring; the reverse sequence carries higher risk.  \n\nTherefore, offer 12 months of durvalumab consolidation (or enroll in a trial of osimertinib); routine use of osimertinib in this setting is premature.",

Rapidly assess severity of SVC syndrome.  \n   • Severe/life-threatening: proceed to stent ± short course steroids/diuretics; schedule CRT immediately after recovery.  \n   • Mild/moderate: start definitive concurrent CRT promptly; keep stent in reserve if symptoms worsen or fail to improve within 3–5 days.\n\nTherefore, in the scenario described (stage IIIB NSCLC, significant SVC-syndrome symptoms, no prior therapy), endovascular SVC stenting should be the first intervention, with curative-intent concurrent chemoradiation initiated as soon as feasible thereafter.",

Nevertheless, if the mutation is detected on validated molecular testing, targeted therapy is considered actionable regardless of histology.\n\n• Alternative first-line options  \n  – Platinum doublet ± pembrolizumab (KEYNOTE-407) or single-agent pembrolizumab (PD-L1 ≥ 50 %) remain acceptable.  \n  – Choice may be individualised (symptom burden, PD-L1 level, toxicity profile, patient preference, access).\n\n• Practical pearls  \n  – Typical starting doses: dabrafenib 150 mg PO bid + trametinib 2 mg PO qd.  \n  – Common toxicities: fever, rash, fatigue, ocular/skin toxicities; monitor for cardiomyopathy and uveitis.  \n  – If rapid disease control is urgently needed, response kinetics with dabrafenib/trametinib are usually quick (weeks).\n\nBottom line: In metastatic NSCLC with a confirmed BRAF V600E mutation, including the uncommon squamous variant, first-line dabrafenib + trametinib is guideline-endorsed and clinically reasonable to prioritise over standard platinum chemotherapy, provided there are no contraindications and the patient is counselled on benefits and risks.",

If PD-L1 ≥50 %, pembrolizumab monotherapy (or pembrolizumab-based chemo-immunotherapy if rapid disease control is needed) is the preferred option. KRAS-G12C blockade is reserved for second-/later-line therapy.\n\n• Biological rationale: KRAS-mutant tumours, especially those with a smoking signature, tend to be TMB-high and immunogenic; they respond to anti-PD-(L)1 at rates comparable to, or slightly higher than, KRAS-wild-type tumours. High PD-L1 expression therefore predicts substantial benefit from first-line immunotherapy, whereas first-line efficacy data for KRAS-G12C inhibitors are still investigational.\n\nConclusion: In a patient with advanced non-squamous NSCLC, KRAS G12C mutation and PD-L1 ≥50 %, first-line treatment should be pembrolizumab monotherapy (or chemo-IO if clinically indicated). KRAS-G12C–directed therapy should be held in reserve for progression, unless the patient can be enrolled in a clinical trial evaluating these agents in the first-line setting.",

Two randomized phase-II trials (Gomez et al. 2016/2020, Iyengar et al. 2018) that enrolled NSCLC patients with ≤3–5 metastases required initial systemic therapy (2–4 cycles of chemotherapy or ≥3 mo of targeted/immunotherapy). Only patients without progression received stereotactic body RT (SBRT), surgery, or RFA to all sites; PFS and OS were significantly prolonged (mPFS 14-23 mo vs 4-6 mo; mOS 38-41 mo vs 17-26 mo).  \n3.

  "306": "No.  Re-excision is preferred but it is NOT the only acceptable option.\n\nCurrent guideline position  \n• NCCN, ESMO and ASTRO/ESTRO all state:  \n  – If a patient with pathologic stage I (T1-2 N0) NSCLC has an R1 or R2 margin, completion re-resection to obtain an R0 is the first choice provided the patient can tolerate another operation (category 1/strong recommendation).  \n  – When re-operation is technically impossible or the patient’s cardiopulmonary reserve or comorbidities make further surgery unsafe, postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) is an accepted definitive alternative (category 2A).  \n\nRadiotherapy details  \n• R1 (microscopic residual): conventionally fractionated PORT 50–54 Gy (2 Gy/fx) to the involved bronchial/staple line ± adjacent nodal stations.  \n• R2 (gross residual): 60–66 Gy with conformal 3-D/IMRT; SBRT boost can be used for small, gross residual lesions.  \n• No adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended for true stage I N0 disease; concurrent chemo-RT is generally reserved for R2 disease with bulk residual tumour or when nodal upstaging is discovered.  \n• Reported local-control rates with modern PORT or SBRT in this setting are 70–90 %, and 5-year overall survival approximates that seen after successful completion resection when there is no nodal disease.\n\nPractical approach  \n1. Multidisciplinary review.  \n2. If re-resection feasible and patient fit → proceed to completion lobectomy/sleeve/pneumonectomy to obtain R0.  \n3. If not feasible/unsafe → deliver PORT to the positive margin (dose per above).  \n4.

Safety: selpercatinib is generally better tolerated than chemo-IO; the main added concern is higher-grade transaminitis when the drug is started soon (< 3 mo) after PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. This is manageable with closer LFT monitoring (q1–2 weeks for the first 3 months) and does not justify delaying therapy.  \n3. Sequence: delaying the targeted agent until “maintenance” or progression risks loss of disease control and exposes the patient to unnecessary toxicities.\n\nPractical approach\n• Complete the current chemotherapy/IO infusion if it has already been given.  \n• Hold further doses, document baseline LFTs, and start selpercatinib after an appropriate wash-out (≈ 2 weeks for cytotoxic chemotherapy; ≥ 2–4 weeks after the last ICI dose is commonly used, though not mandated by guidelines).  \n• Monitor LFTs every 1–2 weeks for 3 months, then monthly.\n\nException\nIf the patient is deriving extraordinary benefit without toxicity (e.g., deep partial response) and strongly prefers to continue, shared decision-making is acceptable, but evidence supports early switch.\n\nBottom line: Switch to selpercatinib as soon as the RET fusion is confirmed; do not wait to complete the planned first-line systemic therapy.",

After a clearly pathogenic oncogenic driver has already been identified  \n   • The canonical kinase drivers (EGFR, ALK, ROS1, RET, NTRK, METex14, BRAF) are almost always mutually exclusive with KRAS G12C.  \n   • Therefore, if a validated KRAS-G12C mutation has already been reported, additional testing for EGFR, ALK, ROS1 and the other mutually exclusive drivers is not required before you start systemic therapy; it will not change first-line choice.  \n   • The only other mandatory biomarker before systemic therapy is PD-L1 immunohistochemistry to guide the use of immunotherapy.\n\nAnswer  \nNo. Once a pathogenic KRAS G12C mutation has been confirmed, repeating or extending molecular testing to look for EGFR, ALK, ROS1 or other canonical drivers is not routinely necessary before starting treatment; PD-L1 testing is the only additional standard assay still required.",

Confirm the result (NGS or FISH) and review histology (rare in squamous, but if real, it is actionable).  \n2. If the patient is clinically stable:  \n   – Stop the current regimen after completing the cycle in progress.  \n   – Allow an immune-checkpoint inhibitor wash-out of ≈2–4 weeks if on pembrolizumab/atezolizumab to reduce the risk of ROS1-TKI hepatotoxicity.  \n3.

In that situation each tumour is staged individually and the overall stage is the highest stage of any single tumour.\n\n• Which applies in the scenario described?  \n  – The question states that both lesions are biopsy-proven and “suggestive of multiple primary lung cancers”; therefore they should be managed as synchronous primary tumours, not as IPM, even though one of the lesions automatically creates a T3 descriptor by location.\n\n• Therapeutic implications  \n  1. MPLC (different primaries)  \n     – Goal: curative local treatment for every lesion.  \n     – Surgical strategy: resect all tumours if cardiopulmonary reserve permits (e.g., lobectomy for the dominant lesion plus anatomic or wedge resection for the second), with systematic nodal dissection.  \n     – If a lesion is unresectable or the patient is marginal for surgery, stereotactic body RT (SBRT) is acceptable for that focus.  \n     – Adjuvant chemotherapy is decided by the highest pathologic stage of any individual tumour (e.g., ≥T2 or N1).

Even here the recommendation is “may omit OR may give endocrine therapy” (NCCN category 2A).\n\n• Rationale  \n  – ER-positive micro- and small-volume cancers have a low but non-zero risk of late recurrence.  \n  – Five years of tamoxifen lowers that risk by ≈40–50 % in relative terms; the absolute benefit is smaller than in larger tumors but is still measurable, especially in younger women with long life expectancy.  \n  – Toxicity of tamoxifen in healthy premenopausal women is generally modest.\n\n• Practical approach  \n  1. Explain to the patient that her baseline 10-year risk of distant recurrence is probably <5 %.  \n  2. Tamoxifen 20 mg daily for 5 years would reduce that risk by ~2 % in absolute terms.  \n  3.

Response rates to EGFR-TKIs (RR ≈ 30-50 %, median PFS 5-8 mo) are clearly lower than those seen with classical exon-19 deletions or L858R.  \n• Virtually all efficacy data come from adenocarcinoma cohorts; true squamous cancers were largely excluded. Reported responses in confirmed squamous tumours are anecdotal.  \n• Afatinib is the only TKI with regulatory and NCCN endorsement (category 2A) for G719X, but the guideline states that in squamous histology it is “an option after progression on first-line chemotherapy/immunotherapy or when those options are not feasible.”  \n• Immunotherapy-containing regimens (e.g. carboplatin-paclitaxel-pembrolizumab) deliver OS ≥ 15 mo in stage IV squamous disease and remain the evidence-based front-line choice.  \n• EGFR-mutant tumours respond poorly to immune-checkpoint monotherapy, but chemo-immunotherapy still produces benefit and has the most robust data in squamous NSCLC.\n\nTherefore\n1. Verify the pathology (repeat biopsy or IHC to exclude adeno-/adenosquamous mix).  \n2. Use platinum doublet ± PD-(L)1 inhibitor as first-line, guided by PD-L1 expression and patient fitness.  \n3.

If predicted postoperative FEV1 or DLCO is < 30–40 % or VO₂max is ≤ 10 mL kg⁻¹ min⁻¹, the operative risk is considered unacceptable and curative-intent alternatives such as SABR or external-beam radiotherapy should be prioritized.",

Only a handful of squamous cases were enrolled, but responses were documented.  \n• Comparative considerations:\n  – PD-(L)1 immunotherapy (± chemotherapy) yields modest ORR (~10–20 %) when an actionable driver is present.  \n  – Platinum-doublet chemotherapy has lower response rates (25–35 %) and shorter PFS (~5–6 mo).  \n  – Toxicity profile and quality of life with targeted therapy are generally superior.\n\nPractical notes\n• Confirm fusion with a reliable assay (NGS or validated RT-PCR/FISH).  \n• Discuss the limited squamous-specific evidence with the patient, but explain the favorable risk–benefit ratio.  \n• Reserve chemo-immunotherapy for progression or intolerance to the RET inhibitor or if no actionable driver is found.\n\nTherefore, in a RET-fusion-positive advanced squamous NSCLC, initiating a selective RET TKI is appropriate and guideline-concordant; standard chemotherapy or immunotherapy would be second-line alternatives rather than preferred front-line choices.",

This enzyme γ-carboxylates specific glutamate residues near the N-terminus of the nascent vitamin-K-dependent clotting proteins—II, VII (the patient’s deficient factor), IX and X, and proteins C and S.  \n4. γ-Carboxylation creates negatively charged γ-carboxy-glutamate (Gla) residues that bind Ca²⁺, allowing the mature factor VII molecule to anchor to phospholipid membranes and participate efficiently in the tissue-factor complex that activates factor X (and ultimately converts prothrombin to thrombin).  \n5. During the reaction vitamin K-hydroquinone is oxidised to vitamin K-epoxide; vitamin K-epoxide reductase (VKORC1) then regenerates the hydroquinone, completing the cycle.\n\nThus menadiol corrects the functional deficiency by supplying reduced vitamin K for γ-carboxylation, restoring biologically active factor VII.

Detection of the fusion on broad next-generation sequencing performed on an adequate tissue (or high-quality liquid) sample fulfills that requirement, so first-line larotrectinib is appropriate in this metastatic squamous NSCLC case.

Although the pivotal phase-II data were generated almost entirely in adenocarcinoma, no biologic reason or clinical signal suggests the benefit would be lost in a squamous tumor, and nothing better targeted is available for this mutation.\n\nWhat should guide the choice?\n\n• Molecular driver status – Presence of a sensitising BRAF V600E mutation strongly favours starting with the matched targeted therapy rather than chemotherapy ± immunotherapy; responses are deeper and faster and PFS (~11 mo) exceeds that seen with chemo-IO in most BRAF-mutated series.  \n• Patient factors – Performance status, need for rapid cytoreduction, ability to tolerate pyrexia/skin toxicities of BRAF/MEK inhibitors versus cytopenias and neuropathy of a platinum doublet.  \n• PD-L1 expression – If PD-L1 ≥ 50 %, single-agent pembrolizumab is permissible, but responses in oncogene-driven disease are generally lower; thus targeted therapy still tends to be favoured first.  \n• Guideline category of evidence – Dabrafenib + trametinib is category 2A (squamous) / 1 (non-squamous) in NCCN; platinum-based chemo-IO doublet is category 1 but only when no targetable driver is present.  \n• Drug access / insurance and patient preference.\n\nBottom line: In a BRAF V600E-mutant stage IV squamous NSCLC it is entirely reasonable—and guideline-supported—to begin with dabrafenib plus trametinib; the decision should be individualised using the factors above but the mutation itself is the chief determinant.",

Give neoadjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy (3–4 cycles, e.g., cisplatin–pemetrexed or cisplatin–docetaxel for nonsquamous; cisplatin–gemcitabine for squamous).  \n     – Increasingly, add an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agent (e.g., nivolumab, pembrolizumab) if no contraindication, per CheckMate-816/KEYNOTE-671 data.  \n  2.

If refined testing shows ppo-FEV₁ or ppo-DLCO ≥ 30 % or VO₂max ≥ 10 mL kg⁻¹ min⁻¹ (or > 35 % predicted), surgery is allowed, albeit high-risk; lobectomy with systematic nodal dissection is still the standard with the best long-term survival.\n3. Only when postoperative function is expected to fall below these thresholds, or other major comorbidities make the risk unacceptable, do non-surgical modalities (stereotactic body radiotherapy, thermal ablation) become the recommended first-line option.\n\nSo, marginal (but not prohibitive) pulmonary function does not, by itself, move surgery behind SBRT; it simply mandates a more detailed physiologic work-up and, if necessary, consideration of a less-extensive resection.",

  "884": "No.  \nConcurrent chemoradiation is reserved for stage III patients who have:  \n\n• Adequate pulmonary reserve (usually FEV1 ≥ 1.2 L and/or ≥ 40% predicted, DLCO ≥ 40%)  \n• Acceptable performance status with limited comorbidity  \n• A tumour position that allows modern-dose radiotherapy while keeping lung, central airways and mediastinal structures within tolerance limits.\n\nIn this case the combination of markedly impaired PFTs and a centrally located tumour means:\n\n1. The baseline risk of symptomatic / fatal radiation pneumonitis is high.  \n2. Central airway and mediastinal dose constraints would be hard to respect, raising the risk of tracheobronchial necrosis, fistula or massive haemorrhage.  \n3. The addition of full-dose concurrent chemotherapy would further increase pulmonary and systemic toxicity.\n\nTherefore, concurrent chemoradiation is not an appropriate first-line approach. Options typically considered instead are:  \n• Induction chemotherapy alone followed by restaging and either limited-field radiotherapy or surgery if pulmonary reserve improves;  \n• Sequential chemo → radiotherapy (lower toxicity than concurrent CRT);  \n• Definitive radiotherapy alone with strict dose constraints or hypofractionated palliative RT;  \n• Best supportive / palliative care if none of the above is feasible.\n\nThus, with significant PFT impairment and central tumour involvement, concurrent chemoradiation should be avoided.",

Assess feasibility of re-resection to achieve R0 (best option).  \n2. If re-resection is not feasible:  \n   • Adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy (4 cycles) →  \n   • Follow with PORT 50–54 Gy to the involved bronchial stump and mediastinum (sequential CRT).  \n   • Consider concurrent CRT only in selected fit patients with small RT volumes.\n\nTherefore, chemoradiation (sequentially or, in selected cases, concurrently) is the recommended strategy; adjuvant chemotherapy alone is inadequate for an R1 resection.",

Therefore leaving out a brain MRI does not make the metastatic work-up inadequate.  \n\n• Stage IIIA (e.g., T3 N1) – Because the incidence of occult brain metastases is substantially higher (≈10–20 %), routine pre-operative brain MRI (or contrast CT) is recommended.

  "892": "Yes – if the tumor truly harbors a sensitising uncommon EGFR mutation (G719X, S768I or L861Q) and no clearly dominant resistance driver is present, an EGFR-TKI such as osimertinib is a guideline-supported first-line option even in a cancer labelled “squamous,” independent of the patient’s smoking history.  \nKey points:\n\n1. Histology  \n• Classic EGFR mutations are rare in pure squamous NSCLC (<3 %), but on small biopsies adenosquamous or mixed tumours are often mis-classified as squamous.  \n• If the mutation is confirmed, most experts treat on the basis of the molecular driver, not the histology. NCCN 2024 lists “Osimertinib or afatinib (Cat 2A)” for these uncommon EGFR mutations, irrespective of histology.\n\n2. Choice of EGFR-TKI  \n• Afatinib has the strongest prospective data and the FDA label for G719X/S768I/L861Q.  \n• Osimertinib has emerging phase-II and real-world evidence showing response rates 50-60 % and median PFS ≈ 8–12 mo for these mutations, with a more favourable toxicity and superior CNS activity; hence NCCN now accepts it as a category 2A first-line alternative.  \n• Therefore starting osimertinib is reasonable practice.\n\n3. Smoking history  \n• Smoking does not diminish EGFR-TKI benefit once an activating EGFR mutation is present; therapy choice should not be altered.\n\n4. Concomitant “squamous-type” mutations  \n• KRAS, STK11, KEAP1 etc. are ordinarily mutually exclusive with activating EGFR alterations.  \n• If validated testing shows a true co-occurring KRAS driver (very rare), EGFR-TKI efficacy is markedly reduced; in that scenario most clinicians would favour chemo-/immunotherapy rather than osimertinib first line.  \n• Absent such a dominant resistance mutation, proceed with EGFR-TKI.\n\nPractical steps  \n• Re-review pathology/IHC; consider repeat biopsy if feasible to rule out adenosquamous.  \n• Obtain comprehensive NGS to look for additional actionable or resistance mutations.  \n• If the uncommon EGFR mutation is isolated, start osimertinib 80 mg daily; switch to standard platinum-based ± IO therapy only on progression or if another driver is found.\n\nIn summary: Osimertinib is an acceptable first-line treatment in metastatic “squamous” NSCLC with a bona-fide uncommon sensitising EGFR mutation; smoking history is irrelevant, but documented co-driver mutations that predict resistance (e.g., KRAS-G12C) would argue against its use.",

Current international guidelines (e.g. NCCN, ESMO) list a ROS1 tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) such as crizotinib or entrectinib as the preferred first-line option (category 1/strong recommendation), because it offers higher response rates (≈70-80 %), longer PFS (≈18-20 months) and less toxicity than platinum-based chemotherapy ± immunotherapy.\n\nConsequences when the rearrangement is discovered after systemic therapy has already begun:\n\n• The optimal management is to stop the cytotoxic/IO regimen and initiate a ROS1-directed TKI as soon as it is safe to do so (allowing any necessary washout from recent immunotherapy to reduce hepatic toxicity).  \n• There is no evidence that finishing the planned chemotherapy or maintenance provides additional benefit once a driver alteration with an available TKI is identified; delaying targeted therapy risks forfeiting its maximal benefit and exposes the patient to avoidable toxicity.  \n• An exception could be a patient who is literally within a week or two of completing the last induction cycle, is deriving a clear radiological benefit, and wishes to finish that cycle; even then, the switch to a ROS1 TKI should not be deferred beyond completion of that short interval.  \n• Continuing pemetrexed maintenance (or IO maintenance) until progression is not recommended once the ROS1 driver is known.\n\nBottom line  \nInitiate ROS1-targeted therapy promptly; do not continue or complete maintenance chemotherapy/IO purely for schedule’s sake unless a very brief delay is unavoidable.",

With “significant” baseline hepatic impairment (e.g., bilirubin >1.5–2× ULN or transaminases >3× ULN), current guidelines and drug labels either contraindicate these drugs or mandate major dose reductions that compromise efficacy.  \n\nTherefore, the usual approach is to:\n\n• Forego/neoadjuvant chemotherapy until liver function normalises, or  \n• Proceed with upfront surgery (lumpectomy ± SLNB or mastectomy) and reassess adjuvant therapy once hepatic parameters improve, or  \n• Consider a modified or alternative regimen only if liver function can safely accommodate it (which is uncommon in significant impairment).\n\nIn short, standard preoperative systemic chemotherapy is generally not recommended when significant hepatic dysfunction is present.",

Complete the infusion day (or current cycle) if already underway.  \n2. Discontinue further cytotoxic/maintenance chemotherapy.  \n3. Initiate crizotinib (or preferred next-generation ALK inhibitor) once counts recover (usually within 1–2 weeks).  \n4.
